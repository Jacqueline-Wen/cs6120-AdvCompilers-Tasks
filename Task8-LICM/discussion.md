## Pass
For this assignment, we implemented LICM with LLVM. We noticed that LLVM had a lot of pre-built functions, such as `llvm::hasLoopInvariantOperands`, and we used this to make our lives a little easier. We implemented the LICM optimization as decribed on the website using the same skeleton as Task7.
